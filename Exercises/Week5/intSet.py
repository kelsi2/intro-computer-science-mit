# Your task is to define the following two methods for the intSet class:

# Define an intersect method that returns a new intSet containing elements that appear in both sets. In other words,

# s1.intersect(s2)
# would return a new intSet of integers that appear in both s1 and s2. Think carefully - what should happen if s1 and s2 have no elements in common?

# Add the appropriate method(s) so that len(s) returns the number of elements in s.

# Hint: look through the Python docs to figure out what you'll need to solve this problem.
